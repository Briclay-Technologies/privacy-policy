        Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Briclay Technologies Private
        Limited. ( <strong>"Briclay,"</strong> <strong>"we,"</strong> or
        <strong>"us"</strong>) and our Web site at www.briclay.com (the
        <strong>"Site"</strong>), as well as all related web sites, networks,
        embeddable widgets, downloadable software, mobile applications
        (including tablet applications), and other services provided by us and
        on or through which a link to this Privacy Policy (this
        <strong>"Policy"</strong>) is displayed (collectively, together with the
        Site, our <strong>"Service"</strong>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This Policy describes the information that we gather from you on the
        Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take
        to protect such information. By using the Service, you consent to the
        privacy practices described in this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Briclay Privacy
        Policy and Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
        Policy have the meaning given to them in the Briclay Privacy Policy and
        Terms of Use.

      <h2>The information we collect on the Service:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User-provided Information:</strong> When you use the Service,
          you may provide and we may collect what is generally called
          <strong>"personally identifiable"</strong> information, or
          <strong>"personal information,"</strong> which is information that
          specifically identifies an individual. Examples of personal
          information include name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone
          number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal
          information also includes other information, such as date of birth,
          geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked
          to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide
          us with personal information in various ways on the Service. For
          example, you provide us with personal information when you register
          for an account, use the Service, post User Content, make a purchase on
          the Service, interact with other users of the Service through
          communication or messaging features, or send us customer
          service-related requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><strong>"Cookies"</strong> Information:</strong> When you use
          the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files
          containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We
          may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
          disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
          after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on
          subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser
          “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
          Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from
          the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the
          Service to their fullest potential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Automatically Collected” Information.</strong> When you use
          the Service, we may automatically record certain information. This
          “automatically collected” information may include your IP address or
          other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web
          pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the
          Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact
          with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access,
          or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect
          information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as
          whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This
          information is gathered from all users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third Party Content and Buttons.</strong> We may also
          implement third-party content or advertising on the Service.
          Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook
          “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect
          information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies,
          even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected
          through the buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and
          Briclay does not participate in that data transmission. Information
          collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third
          party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrated Services.</strong> You may be given the option to
          access or register for the Service through the use of your user name
          and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an
          “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook
          credentials through Facebook Connect, or otherwise have the option to
          authorise an Integrated Service to provide personal information or
          other information to us. By authorising us to connect with an

          Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated
          Service to understand and change the information sent to us through
          each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms
          of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and
          connecting to our Service.

          information, including personal information, from third parties and
          sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and
          Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other
          sources with personal information that we collect through the Service,
          we will treat the combined information as personal information in

        <strong>Delivery, Delivery Fee, Other Fees, and Delivery Time</strong>
        <br />Last-mile delivery services are part of the sale of Products
        purchased by You on the Platform. The Company shall provide delivery of
        the Products upon purchase during such time period as communicated to
        You through the Platform. The Company endeavors to show the estimated
        delivery time for every order; however, the exact delivery time of each
        order may vary due to factors such as availability of third-party
        delivery service providers, demand, traffic, weather conditions, or a
        force majeure event. You can check the estimated time of arrival (ETA)
        on the homepage of the App even before placing an order to ensure
        awareness of the ETA. You agree that the Company reserves the right to
        charge fees for rain, peak hours, very high demand, late-night delivery,
        packing, handling, convenience/platform usage, small cart size, or any
        other applicable fees. These charges will be visible in the “view bill”
        section before the checkout page on the App. The delivery of the
        Products will be made to the delivery address specified by You while
        placing the order on the Platform. You are solely responsible for
        providing a complete and correct delivery address and, if applicable,
        further instructions for delivery. The Company shall not be responsible
        for any delays caused due to the incorrect or incomplete address
        provided by You. The goods will ordinarily be delivered when an
        appropriate person is available to receive the order at the specified
        address. If You request to leave a delivery unattended at Your address,
        You expressly disclaim the Company from any liabilities arising due to
        the unattended delivery. This includes but is not limited to theft,
        tampering, contamination, or changes in temperature for items requiring
        refrigeration. In the event You opt for ‘Cash on Delivery (CoD)’ mode
        and fail to make the complete payment, the Company reserves the right to
        treat the order as canceled and will not be liable for any losses or
        damages. The Company may charge You delivery and other applicable fees
        for such canceled orders to recover the costs incurred during the
        delivery attempt.
